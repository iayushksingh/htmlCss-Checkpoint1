                        But I must explain to you how all this mistaken idea of denouncing pleasure and praising pain 
                        was born and I will give you a complete account of the system, and expound the actual teachings 
                        of the great explorer of the truth, the master-builder of human happiness. No one rejects, dislikes, 
                        or avoids pleasure itself.
